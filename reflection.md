Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

- Overloaded the checkOut and returnBook methods in the Library class to document the name of the user requesting them. The default method can be used in an instance where the book is checked out by library staff for repair etc. While the overloaded methods can be used for normal occurences.

- Overloaded the sellCoffee method in the Cafe class for types of coffee with specific ingredient quantities. 

- Overloaded the constructor in the House class for houses that require an elevator and with a hard coded number of floors in an instance where standard houses are being created in a specific area. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This one felt a lot easier compared to the other assignments. It took me a while to figure out which methods to overload and what they might be used for but they all worked in the end.
